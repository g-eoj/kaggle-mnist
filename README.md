# kaggle Digit Recognizer

https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

MNIST classification with a low parameter convolutional neural network based on [inception modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261).

- `mnist-inception.ipynb`: Where I train models and generate results, which are then appended to a csv file.
- `mnist-inception-results.ipynb`: Used to explore results (which are loaded in from the csv file) and other related ideas.

I'm aiming for over 0.996 validation accuracy before submitting to kaggle.
