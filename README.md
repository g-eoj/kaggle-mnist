# Kaggle Digit Recognizer

MNIST classification with a low parameter convolutional neural network based on [inception modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261).

### Kernels
The 'kernels' folder contains [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels) for Kaggle.
- `mnist-inception-9970-test-acc-kernel.ipynb`: Method for training a 76,264 parameter inception model that scored 99.7% test accuracy in the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

### Exploratory Notebooks
- `mnist-inception.ipynb`: Used to explore methods and generate results, which can be appended to a csv file.
- `mnist-inception-results.ipynb`: Used to explore results (which are loaded in from the csv file) and other related ideas.
